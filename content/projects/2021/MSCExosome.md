# Problem Statement

Glioblastomas (GBMs) are one of the most feared cancers due to their overwhelming invasiveness, heterogeneity, and recurrence rate. In addition, the existence of the blood brain barrier (BBB) makes it difficult to efficiently dose and target tumors in the brain. Exosomes, however, are one of the few acellular biologics that can efficiently cross the BBB. Their unique potential comes from their ability to carry molecular cargo within them and serve as a potential therapeutic. Accordingly, our current project is to leverage exosomes as a potential therapeutic for GBMs. Currently we are conducting a review on exosomes in relation to the BBB and GBMs to help guide our initial experiments where we aim to discover the mechanism of exosome transport across the BBB.
