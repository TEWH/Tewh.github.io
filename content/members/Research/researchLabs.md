## Biomedical Engineering (BME) Labs 

Of course, the first place to start looking for biomedical research is the BME department.

{{< details "Click to see more specific research areas!">}}

### Biomedical Imaging
Biomedical imaging is the process of imaging the inside of the body and analyzing medical imaging data (e.g. MRI, CT-Scan) to extract clinically relevant information.

You can find BME labs working in this area [here](https://www.bme.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/research/imaging).

### Cellular & Biomolecular Engineering
Cellular and biomolecular engineering studies the human body at the microscale. Areas include drug design and delivery, gene therapy, immune engineering, synthetic biology, and more.

You can find BME labs working in this area [here](https://www.bme.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/research/cellular).

### Computational Biomedical Engineering
Computation Biomedical Engineering uses computational techniques to analyze biomedical data. Areas include organ modeling, medical image analysis, tumor modeling, genomics, and more.

You can find BME labs working in this area [here](https://www.bme.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/research/computational).

### Molecular, Cellular & Tissue Biomechanics
Biomechanics studies the structure and function of biology systems through a mechanical lens. This can range from the mechanical properties of tissues all the way down to the cell membrane.

You can find BME labs working in this area [here](https://www.bme.utexas.edu/people/faculty-directory/research/biomechanics).

## Biology Labs
If you are looking for wet lab or translational research, you can check out the biology and molecular biology departments. Unlike, the BME department not all of these labs will have a quantitative focus (but there are plenty that do!)

## Labs from Non-Biomedical Departments
Even though some departments may not have "*bio*" in their name, it does not mean they do not conduct biomedical research. If you want to try to tackle biomedical problems through the perspective of another engineering field, check out these labs from the Engineering and CS departments!
